    strategy:
      ## Only test basic cases on PR trigger, because the `cb() never called` issue happens too often, blocking our PRs.
      ## Our original test matrix is quite big, and every case will run `npm install` once, so it is more likely for us to encounter this issue.
      ## Cut the number of test cases to minimize impact.
      ##
      ## Details about this issue: https://github.com/npm/cli/wiki/%22cb()-never-called%3F--I'm-having-the-same-problem!%22
      ### tl;dr: This error is not one thing, but a category of errors. It means "something broke and we didn't have a way to catch it". We will always need a lot of detail to reproduce an error like this, or we cannot ever fix it. Every instance is unique, and your cb() never called is nothing like any other.
