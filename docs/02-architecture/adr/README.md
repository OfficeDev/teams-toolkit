# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Numbered, dated, immutable records of architectural decisions for the
Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit engine.

See [`../README.md`](../README.md) for what counts as an architectural
decision. The format for a new ADR is defined inline below under
[Adding a new ADR](#adding-a-new-adr).

## Status legend

- **Proposed** — open backlog item. Problem stated, options listed, decision
  pending. Safe to edit until status changes.
- **Accepted** — decided. **Immutable**. To revisit, write a new ADR and mark
  the old one `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`.
- **Superseded** — replaced by a newer ADR. Kept for history.

## Adding a new ADR

0. **Reserve the number first.** If a proposal or fact page names a future ADR
   before its body exists, add a `Planned` row to the Index now (taking the
   next free number) and reference it by **bare id** in prose — never a
   markdown link — until the file is committed. This makes the number
   unspendable by another branch and avoids dangling links.
1. Create `ADR-NNNN-<slug>.md` (the reserved or next free number) using the
   template below.
2. Fill in **Status** (`Proposed`), **Date**, **Source**, **Context**, and
   **Options considered**. Leave **Decision** and **Consequences** as
   `(Pending.)` until the decision is made.
3. Flip the Index row from `Planned` to `Proposed` (or add a new row).
4. In the **same PR**, convert every bare-id forward reference to a markdown
   link and link the ADR from the fact page / open question that triggered it.

## Template

Copy everything inside the fenced block into a new `ADR-NNNN-<slug>.md`:

````markdown
# ADR-NNNN — <title>

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **Source:** <link to the fact page / open question that triggered this ADR>

## Context

What is the problem? Cite the relevant fact page under
[`../external-dependencies/`](../external-dependencies/README.md) — or the
architecture page — that triggered this decision, rather than restating its
content. Some ADRs are forced by external facts; others arise from purely
internal concerns (composition pattern, error model, module boundaries). Both
are valid; name which kind this is. Keep this to the *why* of the decision —
do not describe the current code.

## Options considered

- **A —** …
- **B —** …
- **C —** …

## Decision

(Pending. Filled in when status moves to `Accepted`.)

## Consequences

(Pending. Filled in when status moves to `Accepted`. List any new constraints
this decision introduces; add them to the relevant fact page or architecture
page in the same PR.)
