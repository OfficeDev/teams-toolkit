# Scenario - Create Declarative Agent by Upgrading an Existing Office Add-in (`declarative-agent-meta-os-upgrade-project`)

- **Status:** Accepted (v4 migration of the v3 MetaOS upgrade create template) - ready for scenario-tier (T3) tests
- **Domain:** [`01-scaffolding`](../../domains/01-scaffolding.md)
- **Scenario ID:** `SCN-DA-CREATE-METAOS-UPGRADE-PROJECT`
- **Template id:** `declarative-agent-meta-os-upgrade-project` (create)

This is the vertical contract for the native v4 Declarative Agent with Office Add-in Action upgrade package. The v3 path rendered no Office project template content: it copied an existing Office Add-in project into the new project folder, filtered generated/runtime files, extended the copied project with Declarative Agent manifests and Office action handlers, upgraded `office-addin-debugging`, and unified the Teams app id. The v4 package preserves that Office-project behavior as an explicit post-render pipeline step, and renders only the minimal lifecycle baseline required for the created project to be usable by CLI/VS Code surfaces.

## Acceptance Criteria

| ID                           | Tier | Given                                                                                                                       | When                  | Then                                                                                                                                            |

## Composed operations

- [`walk-create-selector`](../../operations/scaffolding/walk-create-selector.md) - routes Office DA MetaOS upgrade to this v4 package.
- [`run-scaffold-pipeline`](../../operations/scaffolding/run-scaffold-pipeline.md) - renders lifecycle baseline content and runs the upgrade step.

## Boundary

This scenario covers only the Office DA MetaOS upgrade create path. It does **not** cover generic Office Add-in import/config upgrade or the DA MetaOS new-project template.
