      # Build the project.
      # The way to build the current project depends on how you scaffold it.
      # Different folder structures require different commands set.
      # 'npm ci' may be used here to install dependencies and it depends on package-lock.json.
      # If you prefer to use 'npm ci', please make sure to commit package-lock.json first, or just change it to 'npm install'.  
      # cd bot; npm install; cd -;

      # Run unit test.
      # Currently, no opinioned solution for unit test provided during scaffolding, so,
      # set up any unit test framework you prefer (for example, mocha or jest) and update the commands accordingly in below.
      # npm run test
