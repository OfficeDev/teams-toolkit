    ## Step 2: Get your access token


    An access token is automatically generated using a default `client_id` and
    `secret`. PayPal recommends using your own `client_id` and `secret` from the
    [Developer
    Dashboard](https://www.paypal.com/signin?intent=developer&returnUri=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.paypal.com%2Fdeveloper%2Fapplication)
    by entering the values under the **Variables** tab. A pre-request script
    will generate and manage the `access_token` automatically.


    > **Note:** Your developer account `client_id` and `secret` may have a
    different scope than the default `client_id` and `secret`.


    ## Step 3: Make your first API call


    PayPal recommends starting with the Orders API. These steps will use the
    Orders API to create an order and capture payment using [sandbox
    accounts](https://developer.paypal.com/developer/accounts) linked to your
    Developer Dashboard account.


    To create an order:


    1. In your workspace, navigate to your fork of the PayPal collection.

    1. Select **Orders > Create Order**.

    1. Select the **Send** button to create the order. On a successful call, the
    API returns a 201 order created response code.

    1. In the response, find the **approve** link.

    1. Open the **approve** link in a browser.

    1. Log in with your Developer Dashboard Sandbox Personal Account
    credentials. You can find those credentials by logging into the Developer
    Dashboard and selecting **Sandbox > Account**

    1. Select the **Continue** button. Payment has now been made.


    To capture payment:


    1. In the response of the order you created, find the `order_id`.

    1. In the **Variables** tab, enter the `order_id` number.

    1. Select **Orders > Capture payment for order**.

    1. Select **Send**. On a successful call, the API returns a 201 order
    created response code.


    Your order has been created and payment has been captured. You can verify
    the transaction in both the sandbox personal account and the sandbox
    business account.

      An order represents a payment between two or more parties. Use the Orders
      API to create, update, retrieve, authorize, and capture orders.


      Use the `/orders` resource to create, update, retrieve, authorize, and
      capture orders.
  - name: Payments
    description: >-
      Call the Payments API to authorize payments, capture authorized payments,
      refund payments that have already been captured, and show payment
      information. Use the Payments API in conjunction with the <a
      href="https://developer.paypal.com/api/orders/v2/">Orders API</a>. For
      more information, see the <a
      href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/">PayPal Checkout
      Overview</a>.
  - name: Invoices
    description: >-
      Use the Invoicing API to create, send, and manage invoices. You can also
      use the API or webhooks to track invoice payments. When you send an
      invoice to a customer, the invoice moves from draft to payable state.
      PayPal then emails the customer a link to the invoice on the PayPal
      website. Customers with a PayPal account can log in and pay the invoice
      with PayPal. Alternatively, customers can pay as a guest with a debit card
      or credit card. For more information, see the <a
      href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/invoicing/">Invoicing Overview</a>
      and the <a
      href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/invoicing/basic-integration/">Invoicing
      Integration Guide</a>.
  - name: Invoices > Invoices
    description: >-
      Use the `/invoices` resource to create, update, and send invoices and
      invoice reminders. To manage invoices, you can also list invoices, show
      details for invoices, delete draft invoices, and cancel sent invoices. You
      can also record payments for invoices to mark them as fully or partially
      paid, or record refunds for invoices to mark them as fully or partially
      refunded. You can create QR codes for invoices that can be scanned,
      viewed, and paid by a mobile phone.
  - name: Invoices > Templates
    description: >-
      Use the `/templates` resource to create, list, show details for, update,
      and delete invoice templates. Use the `/templates` resource when you
      create a third-party invoicing application. For instance, a business can
      create a template with predefined invoice data. Later, the business can
      select the template to populate the invoice
      data.<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> To upload a logo to display on an
      invoice, you can use the <strong>Template Settings</strong> dashboard to
      <a href="https://www.paypal.com/invoice/settings/templates">create a
      template</a>. When you create an invoice, you can use the URI for that
      logo.</blockquote>
  - name: Subscriptions
    description: >-
      You can use billing plans and subscriptions to create subscriptions that
      process recurring PayPal payments for physical or digital goods, or
      services. A plan includes pricing and billing cycle information that
      defines the amount and frequency of charge for a subscription. You can
      also define a fixed plan, such as a $5 basic plan or a volume- or
      graduated-based plan with pricing tiers based on the quantity purchased.
      For more information, see <a
      href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/subscriptions/">Subscriptions
      Overview</a>.
  - name: Subscriptions > Catalog Products
    description: >-
      Merchants can use the Catalog Products API to create products, which are
      goods and services.


      Use `/products` resource to create and manage products.
  - name: Subscriptions > Plans
    description: Use the `/billing/plans` resource to create and manage plans.
  - name: Subscriptions > Subscriptions
    description: >-
      Use the `/billing/subscriptions` resource to create and manage
      subscriptions.
  - name: Payouts
    description: >-
      Use the Payouts API to make payments to multiple PayPal or Venmo
      recipients. The Payouts API is a fast, convenient way to send commissions,
      rebates, rewards, and general disbursements. You can send up to 15,000
      payments per call. If you integrated the Payouts API before September 1,
      2017, you receive transaction reports through <a
      href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/archive/mass-pay/integration-guide/MassPayReporting/">Mass
      Payments Reporting</a>. Otherwise, <a
      href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/payouts/features/view-reports/">view
      reports from your PayPal Business account</a>. The Payouts API uses the <a
      href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6">ISO 8601 Internet
      date and time format</a>.
  - name: Webhooks
    description: >-
      The PayPal REST APIs use <a
      href="https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/webhooks/"/>webhooks</a> for
      event notification. Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that receive notification
      messages for events. After you configure a webhook listener for your app,
      you can <a href="#webhooks_create">create a webhook</a>, which subscribes
      the webhook listener for your app to events. The
      <code>notifications</code> namespace contains resource collections for
      webhooks.
  - name: Shipment Tracking
    description: >-
      Merchants can use the PayPal Add Tracking API to manage tracking
      information. Merchants can add tracking numbers and associated information
      to PayPal. After adding these details to PayPal, merchants
      can:<ul><li>Update tracking details.</li><li>Show tracking
      details.</li><li>Cancel tracking numbers.</li></ul>For more information,
      see the <a href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/tracking/">Add Tracking
      API Overview</a> and <a
      href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/tracking/integrate/">Add Tracking
      API Integration Guide</a>.
  - name: Transaction Search
    description: >-
      Use the Transaction Search API to get the history of transactions for a
      PayPal account. To use the API on behalf of third parties, you must be
      part of the PayPal partner network. Reach out to your partner manager for
      the next steps. To enroll in the partner program, see <a
      href="https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/partner-program">Partner with
      PayPal</a>. For more information about the API, see the <a
      href="https://developer.paypal.com/docs/transaction-search/">Transaction
      Search API Integration Guide</a>.
  - name: Disputes
    description: >-
      Occasionally, something goes wrong with a customer's order. To dispute a
      charge, a customer can create a dispute with PayPal. PayPal merchants,
      partners, and external developers can use the PayPal Disputes API to
      manage customer disputes.<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> In the live
      environment, merchants cannot create disputes but can only respond to
      customer-created disputes. However, merchants can create disputes in the
      sandbox environment. When you create an app, enable Disputes in the App
      feature options section.</blockquote>A customer can also ask his or her
      bank or credit card company to dispute and reverse a charge, which is
      known as a <i>chargeback</i>. For more information, see <a
      href="https://www.paypal.com/us/brc/article/customer-disputes-claims-chargebacks-bank-reversals">Disputes,
      claims, chargebacks, and bank reversals</a>.<br/><br/>When a customer
      disputes a charge, you can use this API to provide evidence that the
      charge is legitimate. To provide evidence or appeal a dispute, you submit
      a proof of delivery or proof of refund document or notes, which can
      include logs.<br/><br/>Normally, an agent at PayPal creates a dispute,
      updates the dispute status, and settles disputes, but now you can run test
      cases in the sandbox that complete these
      operations.<br/><br/><blockquote><strong>Important:</strong> The create,
      cancel, compute metrics, change reason, and validate eligibility methods
      are available as a limited-release solution at this time. For more
      information, reach out to your PayPal account
      manager.</blockquote><br/>For details, see <a

      description: >-
        Reauthorizes an authorized PayPal account payment, by ID. To ensure that
        funds are still available, reauthorize a payment after its initial
        three-day honor period expires. Within the 29-day authorization period,
        you can issue multiple re-authorizations after the honor period
        expires.<br/><br/>If 30 days have transpired since the date of the
        original authorization, you must create an authorized payment instead of
        reauthorizing the original authorized payment.<br/><br/>A reauthorized
        payment itself has a new honor period of three days.<br/><br/>You can
        reauthorize an authorized payment once for up to 115% of the original
        authorized amount, not to exceed an increase of $75
        USD.<br/><br/>Supports only the `amount` request
        parameter.<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> This request is currently
        not supported for Partner use cases.</blockquote>

      summary: Create batch payout
      description: >-
        Creates a batch payout. In the JSON request body, pass a
        `sender_batch_header` and an `items` array. The `sender_batch_header`
        defines how to handle the payout. The `items` array defines the payout
        items.<br/>You can make payouts to one or more
        recipients.<blockquote><strong>Notes:</strong> <ul><li><p>PayPal does
        not process duplicate payouts. If you specify a
        <code>sender_batch_id</code> that was used in the last 30 days, the API
        rejects the request with an error message that shows the duplicate
        <code>sender_batch_id</code> and includes a HATEOAS link to the original
        payout with the same <code>sender_batch_id</code>.</p><p>If you receive
        an HTTP <code>5<i>nn</i></code> status code, you can safely retry the
        request with the same <code>sender_batch_id</code>.</p></li><li><p>The
        Payouts API does not support build notation (BN) codes. In a future
        Payouts release, you can optionally provide BN codes in the
        <code>PayPal-Partner-Attribution-Id</code> request header.</p><p>For
        information about the <code>PayPal-Partner-Attribution-Id</code> header,
        see <a
        href="https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/requests/#http-request-headers">HTTP
        request headers</a>. To learn about or request a BN code, contact your

        events look. <blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> You can also use the <a

      summary: Provide supporting information for dispute
      description: >-
        Provides supporting information for a dispute, by ID. A merchant or
        buyer can make this request for disputes if they find the
        `provide-supporting-info` link in the HATEOAS links in the list disputes
        response. The party can provide the supporting information to PayPal to
        defend themselves only when the `dispute_life_cycle_stage` is
        `CHARGEBACK`, `PRE_ARBITRATION`, or `ARBITRATION`. They can provide a
        note that describes their part with details or upload any supporting
        documents to support their side. The following rules apply to document
        file types and sizes:<ul><li>The party can upload up to 50 MB of files
        for a case.</li><li>Individual files must be smaller than 10
        MB.</li><li>The supported file formats are JPG, GIF, PNG, and
        PDF.</li></ul><br/>To make this request, specify the dispute ID in the
        URI and specify the notes in the JSON request body. This method differs
        from the provide evidence method which supports only multipart request,
        where PayPal asks the concerned party for evidence.
