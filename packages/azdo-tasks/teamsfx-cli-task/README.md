```

### Configure M365/Azure credentials as GitHub Secret:

To use any credentials, add them as [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) in the GitHub repository and then use them in the workflow.

[TeamsFx CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/teamsfx-cli) relies on environment variables to provide login credentials for Azure and M365. The table below lists all of the environment variables.
|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|AZURE_ACCOUNT_NAME|The account name of Azure which is used to provision resources.|
|AZURE_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD|The password of Azure account.|
|AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID|To identify the subscription in which the resources will be provisined.|
|AZURE_TENANT_ID|To identify the tenant in which the subscription resides.|
|M365_ACCOUNT_NAME|The M365 account for creating and publishing Teams App.|
|M365_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD|The password of M365 account.|
|M365_TENANT_ID|To identify the tenant in which the Teams App will be created/published.|

*PS:* To make these credentials work in environment variables, there should not exist any interactive part of the login process, so extra configurations should be made. These operations have risks, so be aware of that and try to make your password complicated, and the way to login by service principal in environment variables will be supported in the future.
* For M365 account, the multi-factor authentication should be disabled (needs org admin's permission).
1. Login to [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/).
2. Click Users > Active users > Multi-factor authentication.
3. Select the M365 account you want to configure, click `disable` from the right panel.
* For Azure account, the account's security defaults under the specific tenant which resources will be provisioned in should be turned off, and please refer to [Disabling security defaults](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/concept-fundamentals-security-defaults#disabling-security-defaults).

In the meantime, the Azure/M365 accounts provided here should have sufficient permissions.
