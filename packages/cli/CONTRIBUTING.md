Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to TeamsFx CLI!

## Prerequisites

Verify you have the right prerequisites for building Teams apps:

### M365 account

The TeamsFx CLI requires a Microsoft 365 organizationl account where Teams is running and has been registered.

### Azure account
The TeamsFx CLI may require an Azure account and subscription to deploy the Azure resources for your project.

**_NOTE:_** Don't have a M365 to experience building Teams app? Sign up for [M365 Developer Program](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant), which allows you to have a testing tenant with preconfigured permissions.

## Setup Development Environment

### Build the whole monorepo

### Build CLI package alone
1. `cd packages/cli/`
2. `npm install`
