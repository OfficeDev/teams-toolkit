-------------------------

Files generated/updated in your project
-------------------------

1. New file - 'aad.template.json' is created in folder 'templates/appPackage'
   - The Azure Active Directory application manifest that is used to register the application with AAD.
2. Update file - 'templates/appPackage/manifest.template.json'
   - An 'webApplicationInfo' object will be added into your Teams app manifest template. This field is required by Teams when enabling SSO.
3. New file - 'Auth/tab'
   - Sample code and a 'README.txt' file. These files are provided for reference. See below for more information.
4. Update file - 'appsettings.json' and 'appsettings.Development.json'
   - Configs that will be used by TeamsFx SDK will be added into your app settings. Please update add the 'TeamsFx' object if you have other appsettings files.

Actions required - update your code to add SSO authentication
-------------------------

You need to update your application code to take advantage of the SSO authentication.

1. Move 'GetUserProfile.razor' file from 'Auth/tab' folder to 'Components/' folder.
   - 'GetUserProfile': This file implements a function that uses TeamsFx SDK to call Microsoft Graph API to get user info.
2. Rplace the 'AddSSO' component with 'GetUserProfile' component. To do this, just replace the following line: '<AddSSO />' with '<GetUserProfile />' in 'Components/Welcome.razor' file.

Debug your application
-------------------------

1. Right-click your project and select Teams Toolkit > Prepare Teams app dependencies
2. If prompted, sign in with an M365 account for the Teams organization you want 
to install the app to
3. Press F5, or select the Debug > Start Debugging menu in Visual Studio
4. In the launched browser, select the Add button to load the app in Teams

Teams Toolkit will use the AAD manifest file to register a AAD application registered for SSO.
