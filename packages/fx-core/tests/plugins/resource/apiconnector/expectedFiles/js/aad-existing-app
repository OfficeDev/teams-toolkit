Your next steps:
1. Run npm install. If your project did not install @microsoft/teamsfx package before, we have added it to package.json for you.
   You need to run the command under "bot" folder instead of project's root folder.
2. Replace "<your-api-scope>" in this file with actual scope required by the API.
3. Add your client secret to TEAMSFX_API_FAKE_CLIENT_SECRET in "bot/.env.teamsfx.local".

You can now import the API client (an Axios instance) in another file and call test APIs without worrying about authentication.
Here is an example for a GET request to "relative_path_of_target_api":
```
const { testClient } = require("{relative_path_to_this_file}");

const response = await testClient.get("relative_path_of_target_api");
// You only need to enter the relative path for your API.
// For example, if you want to call api https://my-api-endpoint/test, and inputted https://my-api-endpoint as API endpoint,
// the code will looks like: const response = await testClient.get("test");

const responseBody = response.data;
```

If you added this API while local debugging, please stop local debugging and start again because local debugging will not hot reload changes to .env.teamsfx.local

Setting API configuration for cloud environment: 
We have already set the configuration to .env.teamsfx.local based on your answers. 
Before you deploy your code to cloud using TeamsFx, please follow https://aka.ms/teamsfx-add-appsettings to add following app settings with appropriate value to your Azure environment: 
TEAMSFX_API_FAKE_ENDPOINT
TEAMSFX_API_FAKE_TENANT_ID
