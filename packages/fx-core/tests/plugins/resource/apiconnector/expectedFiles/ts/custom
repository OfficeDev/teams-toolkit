/*
Your next steps:
1. Run npm install. If your project did not install @microsoft/teamsfx package before, we have added it to package.json for you.
   You need to run the command under "bot" folder instead of project's root folder.
2. Refer sample code and comments in this file to implement your auth provider.

You can now import the API client (an Axios instance) in another file and call fake APIs without worrying about authentication.
Here is an example for a GET request to "relative_path_of_target_api":
const result = await fakeClient.get("relative_path_of_target_api");

Setting API configuration for cloud environment: 
We have already set the configuration to .env.teamsfx.local based on your answers. 
Before you deploy your code to cloud using TeamsFx, please follow https://aka.ms/teamsfx-add-appsettings to add following app settings with appropriate value to your Azure environment: 
TEAMSFX_API_FAKE_ENDPOINT
