Called when a prompt dialog is the active dialog and the user replied with a new activity.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
continueDialog(dc: DialogContext): Promise<DialogTurnResult>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  dc | DialogContext | The DialogContext for the current turn of the conversation. |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;DialogTurnResult&gt;

A `Promise` representing the asynchronous operation.

## Exceptions

[ErrorCode.ChannelNotSupported](./teamsfx.errorcode.channelnotsupported.md) when bot channel is not MS Teams.

[ErrorCode.RuntimeNotSupported](./teamsfx.errorcode.runtimenotsupported.md) when runtime is browser.

## Remarks

If the task is successful, the result indicates whether the dialog is still active after the turn has been processed by the dialog. The prompt generally continues to receive the user's replies until it accepts the user's reply as valid input for the prompt.
