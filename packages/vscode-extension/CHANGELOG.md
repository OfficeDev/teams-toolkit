- **Clean up `.deployment` Folder in between Deployments**: Teams Toolkit now cleans up the `.deployment` folder in the build directory before each deployment, addressing a [known issue](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/issues/10075) and reducing deployment time.
- **Optimized Dev Tunnel Expiration**: Inactive Dev Tunnel instances will now be automatically cleaned up after an hour, mitigating Dev Tunnel instance limitation errors.
