# Teams Toolkit Pre-release

## Changelog

> Note: This changelog only includes the changes for the pre-release versions of Teams Toolkit. For the changelog of stable versions, please refer to the [Teams Toolkit Changelog](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/blob/dev/packages/vscode-extension/CHANGELOG.md).

### September 17, 2024

#### Enhancement

- Updated terminology for creating `Copilot Extension` and `Custom Engine Copilot` to enhance clarity.
- Updated `Declarative Agent` and `API Plugin` app template to point to the latest manifest schema.

### September 12, 2024

#### New Features

- **External File Support for Declarative Copilot Instructions**: Developers now have the ability to use an external file to author instructions for their declarative copilots and reference it in the manifest file. This greatly improves the authoring experience for longer instructions compared to using JSON files.
![External File](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa13711c-fe8c-4155-bd7f-9e0a8e0ed606)

- **Plugin Integration for Declarative Copilot**: Teams Toolkit now allows developers to add a plugin as a skill to the declarative copilot. Developers can either add a new API plugin using an OpenAPI description document or reference an existing API plugin via its manifest file.
![Add Plugin](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/009a63d0-8bc0-4449-8ba6-cef25779c140)

#### New Features

- **API-Based Message Extension**: We have introduced a whole new way to build search-based message extension - from a new API with Azure Functions or from your existing API with an OpenAPI description document. This is a great starting point for building a message extension that requires a backend to fetch data from a third-party API or a database.
    ![API-Based Message Extension](https://aka.ms/changelog-img-api-me)

- **Sample App Gallery Search**: We have introduced the ability to search for sample apps within the Sample App Gallery.
    ![Sample Gallery](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/assets/11220663/87a705e2-aa79-46dc-87ba-204f20fd3771)

- **Custom Search Results Template Optimization**: We've optimized the `Custom Search Results` (Using Bot Framework) project template to seamlessly integrate with Microsoft 365 Copilot. To utilize this feature, please enable the `Develop Copilot Plugin` feature setting via Visual Studio Code in the [User and Workspace Settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings) and enroll in the Microsoft 365 Copilot [Early Access Program](https://aka.ms/PluginsEarlyAccess).

## Frequently asked questions

### What does pre-release mean

Pre-release is meant for those eager to try the latest Teams Toolkit features and fixes. Even though pre-releases are not intended for use in production, they are at a sufficient quality level for you to generally use and [provide feedback](https://aka.ms/ttk-feedback). However, pre-release versions can and probably will change, and those changes could be significant.

### What about my existing Teams Toolkit projects

The changes in this pre-release require upgrades to the TeamsFx configuration files. You can migrate by creating a new project and move your exiting code, or Teams Toolkit have also provided a way to automatically upgrade existing Teams apps that were created with a previous version of Teams Toolkit.

Learn more about the changes in this pre-release at [https://aka.ms/teamsfx-v5.0-guide](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-v5.0-guide).
