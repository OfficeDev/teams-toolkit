# experts-router

## purpose

You are the **root task router**. Before doing any work, interview the developer to understand scope and preferences. Then classify intent and load exactly one domain router. Do NOT load micro-expert files directly from here.

## pre-task interview (mandatory)

**Every task starts here.** Before routing, loading experts, or writing any code, interview the developer. The depth scales with the task — a small bug fix may need one confirmation; a multi-file migration needs detailed scoping.

### How it works

1. **Assess complexity.** Read the developer's message. Determine if the task is small (single file, clear intent), medium (multi-file, some ambiguity), or large (architectural, multi-step, cross-cutting).
2. **Ask the right questions.** Use `AskUserQuestion` to walk through the applicable question blocks below. Skip any question the developer's message already answers unambiguously.
3. **Always offer the escape hatch.** Every question set MUST include a **"You decide everything"** (first question) or **"You decide everything else"** (subsequent questions) option. Selecting it means: use your best judgment for all remaining decisions, apply expert defaults, and proceed without further questions.
4. **Record and carry forward.** Store all answers. They shape routing, expert selection, and implementation decisions for the entire task.

### Question blocks

Pick from these based on complexity. You don't need all of them — use judgment.

#### Q1 — Scope & intent (always ask)
```
header: "Scope"
question: "Before I start, let me confirm what you need. Which best describes this task?"
options:
  - label: "You decide everything"
    description: "I trust your judgment — assess the task, make all decisions, and just do it."
  - label: "Quick fix / small change"
    description: "Single file or minor tweak. Just need it done."
  - label: "Feature / migration step"
    description: "Multi-file change with some decisions to make."
  - label: "Architectural / large task"
    description: "Significant scope — I want to review the approach before you start."
multiSelect: false
```

If the developer picks **"You decide everything"** → skip all remaining questions, proceed with expert defaults.

#### Q2 — Approach preferences (medium+ tasks)
```
header: "Approach"
question: "Any preferences on how I tackle this?"
options:
  - label: "You decide everything else"
    description: "No preferences — use best practices and expert defaults."
  - label: "Minimal changes"
    description: "Touch as few files as possible. Keep the diff small."
  - label: "Do it right"
    description: "Refactor if needed. Prioritize correctness and clean code."
  - label: "Let me review first"
    description: "Show me a plan before writing any code."
multiSelect: false
```

If **"Let me review first"** → enter plan mode (`EnterPlanMode`) before implementation.

#### Q3 — Specifics (large tasks or when ambiguity remains)
```
header: "Details"
question: "A few specifics to nail down:"
options:
  - label: "You decide everything else"
    description: "Use your best judgment for all remaining decisions."
  - label: "I'll answer each"
    description: "Walk me through the decisions one at a time."
multiSelect: false
```

If **"I'll answer each"** → proceed to any expert-level `## interview` sections after routing. If **"You decide everything else"** → fill expert interviews with defaults and skip them.

### Interaction with expert-level interviews

The pre-task interview gates the entire workflow. Expert-level `## interview` sections (described in the auto-interview protocol below) handle domain-specific decisions. If the developer chose "You decide everything" or "You decide everything else" at the pre-task level, those expert interviews are auto-filled with defaults and skipped.

## routing rules

Scan the user's message for signal words. Pick the **first matching domain**; if signals overlap, prefer the domain whose signals appear more often.

## auto-interview protocol (expert-level)

After loading any expert, check for a `## interview` section. If one exists **and the developer did NOT choose "You decide everything" / "You decide everything else" in the pre-task interview**, execute the expert interview before writing any code or giving implementation advice.

If the developer DID choose an escape hatch in the pre-task interview, auto-fill all expert interview answers with the expert's documented defaults and skip the questions.

### How it works

1. **Check pre-task answers.** If the developer already opted out of detailed questions, skip to implementation using defaults.
2. **Detect.** After reading an expert file, scan for `## interview`. If missing, proceed directly to implementation.
3. **Execute.** Walk through each question block (`### Q1`, `### Q2`, ...) in order. Use `AskUserQuestion` for each one, following the `header`, `question`, `options`, and `multiSelect` fields exactly as specified.
4. **Record.** Store the developer's answers. Pass them into the expert's rules and patterns as context — the answers shape which code paths, patterns, and configurations apply.
5. **Escape hatch.** Every expert interview MUST include a "You decide everything else" option. Selecting it fills all remaining answers with the expert's documented defaults and skips remaining questions.
6. **Context-skip.** If the developer's original message already answers an interview question unambiguously (e.g., "use Azure OpenAI" when the question is "OpenAI or Azure OpenAI?"), skip that question — don't re-ask what's already known.

### Experts with embedded interviews

Some experts (like `cross-platform-advisor-ts.md`) have the interview woven into their phased workflow rather than in a separate `## interview` section. These already satisfy the protocol — their Phase 2 / decision walkthrough IS the interview.

## ambiguity tiebreaker

If the request mixes **bridge** signals with a target-platform signal (e.g., "convert Block Kit to Adaptive Cards"), route to **bridge** first — bridge experts already reference the target platform's patterns.

If the request mixes **convert** signals with **bridge** signals (e.g., "rewrite this Ruby Slack bot in TypeScript for Teams"), route to **convert** first for language translation, then **bridge** for platform mapping. The convert domain's combining rule handles this layering.

## fallback

If no domain matches, ask **one** clarifying question:
> "Are you working on a Teams bot, a Slack app, a migration between them, or something else?"

If the routed experts don't fully cover the request (gaps remain after the initial pass), read `experts/fallback.md` for a two-phase recovery: re-scan all domain routers for missed experts, then web-search for any remaining gaps.

## expert evolution

The expert system is **self-evolving**. As conversations reveal knowledge gaps, outdated patterns, or new topic areas, update the system in-place. Follow the rules below.

### Naming conventions

| Convention | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `topic-ts.md` | Normal expert — can be created, updated, or replaced |
| `topic-ts.locked.md` | **Locked** — read-only, do NOT edit. Rename to remove `.locked` only with explicit user approval |
| `_filename.md` | System/template file — not a routable expert |
| `index.md` | Domain router — update when adding/removing experts in that domain |

To lock an expert: rename `topic-ts.md` → `topic-ts.locked.md`. The routing system treats `.locked.md` identically for reads — only writes are blocked.

### When to UPDATE an existing expert

Update an expert when **any** of these are true during a conversation:
1. **Corrected mistake** — you discover a rule, code pattern, or pitfall is wrong and fix it in practice. Backport the correction to the expert.
2. **New pattern emerged** — you write a working pattern that isn't covered by any existing expert. Add it to the most relevant expert's `## patterns` section.
3. **SDK/API changed** — the user provides or you discover updated API signatures, new options, or deprecated features. Update the affected rules and patterns.
4. **Missing pitfall** — you hit a gotcha during implementation that the expert didn't warn about. Add it to `## pitfalls`.
5. **Cross-reference gap** — an expert should reference another but doesn't. Add a `Pair with` entry to `## instructions` and update the domain `index.md` cluster.

**Do NOT update locked experts** (`*.locked.md`). If a locked expert needs changes, flag it to the user.

### When to CREATE a new expert

Create a new expert when **all** of these are true:
1. **No existing expert covers the topic** — the knowledge doesn't fit as an addition to any current file.
2. **The topic is reusable** — it will apply to future tasks, not just the current one-off request.
3. **Sufficient depth** — the topic warrants 8+ rules and 2+ code patterns. If it's only 2-3 rules, add them to an existing expert instead.

**Creation steps:**
1. Copy the template from `experts/_expert-ts.md`.
2. Name it `{topic}-ts.md` in the appropriate domain folder.
3. Fill in all sections: purpose, rules, patterns, pitfalls, references, instructions (with `Pair with` cross-refs), research.
4. Complete the **post-creation checklist** from `_expert-ts.md`:
   - Add to domain `index.md` task cluster `Read:` list (with `Depends on:` / `Cross-domain deps:` if applicable).
   - Add to domain `index.md` file inventory.
   - Add signal words to root `index.md` if the new expert introduces terms not already covered.

### When to CREATE a new domain folder

Create a new domain (folder + `index.md` router) when **all** of these are true:
1. **3+ experts** would belong to the new domain — a domain with 1-2 experts should stay as a cluster within an existing domain.
2. **Distinct signal words** — the domain's topics wouldn't naturally route through any existing domain's signals.
3. **Separable routing** — moving these experts out of an existing domain simplifies that domain's router, not complicates it.

**Creation steps:**
1. Create the folder: `experts/{domain-name}/`.
2. Create `experts/{domain-name}/index.md` following the router pattern from any existing domain index (purpose, task clusters with `When:`/`Read:`, combining rule, file inventory).
3. Move or create the expert files in the new folder.
4. Add a new routing entry to this root `index.md` under `## routing rules` with `Signals:` and a `→ Read` directive.
5. Remove any moved experts from their old domain's `index.md`.

### Evolution audit trail

When you modify the expert system, add a one-line comment at the bottom of the affected domain's `index.md`:
```
<!-- Updated YYYY-MM-DD: {what changed and why} -->
```

This lets future sessions see what evolved and when, without cluttering the routing logic.
