# How to use this Bots and Message Extensions HelloWorld app

A bot, chatbot, or conversational bot is an app that responds to simple commands sent in chat and replies in meaningful ways. Examples of bots in everyday use include: bots that notify about build failures, bots that provide information about the weather or bus schedules, or provide travel information. A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a complex conversation. Being a cloud application, a bot can provide valuable and secure access to cloud services and corporate resources.

A Message Extension allows users to interact with your web service while composing messages in the Microsoft Teams client. Users can invoke your web service to assist message composition, from the message compose box, or from the search bar.

Message Extensions are implemented on top of the Bot support architecture within Teams.

This is a simple hello world application with both Bot and Message extension capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- An M365 account. If you do not have M365 account, apply one from [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version after 1.55 or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)

## Debug

- From Visual Studio Code: Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code. 
- Alternatively use the `Run and Debug Activity Panel` in Visual Studio Code and click the `Run and Debug` green arrow button.
- From TeamsFx CLI: Start debugging the project by executing the command `teamsfx preview --local` in your project directory.

## Edit the manifest

You can find the Teams app manifest in `templates/appPackage` folder. The folder contains one manifest file:
* `manifest.template.json`: Manifest file for Teams app running locally or running remotely (After deployed to Azure).

This file contains template arguments with `{...}` statements which will be replaced at build time. You may add any extra properties or permissions you require to this file. See the [schema reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) for more information.

## Deploy to Azure

Deploy your project to Azure by following these steps:

## Play with Message Extension

This template provides some sample functionality:

- You can search for `npm` packages from the search bar.

- You can create and send an adaptive card.

  ![CreateCard](./images/AdaptiveCard.png)

- You can share a message in an adaptive card form.

  ![ShareMessage](./images/ShareMessage.png)

- You can paste a link that "unfurls" (`.botframwork.com` is monitored in this template) and a card will be rendered.

  ![ComposeArea](./images/LinkUnfurlingImage.png)

To trigger these functions, there are multiple entry points:

- `@mention` Your message extension, from the `search box area`.

  ![AtBotFromSearch](./images/AtBotFromSearch.png)

- `@mention` your message extension from the `compose message area`.

  ![AtBotFromMessage](./images/AtBotInMessage.png)

- Click the `...` under compose message area, find your message extension.

  ![ComposeArea](./images/ThreeDot.png)

- Click the `...` next to any messages you received or sent.
