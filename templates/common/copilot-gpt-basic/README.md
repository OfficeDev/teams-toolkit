# Overview of the Copilot GPT template

## Build a Copilot GPT from OpenAPI description document

With Copilot GPT, you can build a custom version of Copilot that can be used for specific scenarios, such as for specialized knowledge, implementing specific processes, or simply to save time by reusing a set of AI prompts. For example, a grocery shopping Copilot GPT can be used to create a grocery list based on a meal plan that you send to the Copilot GPT.
