# Overview of the AI Assistant Bot template

This app template is built on top of [Teams AI library](https://aka.ms/teams-ai-library) and [OpenAI Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview).
It showcases how to build an intelligent chat bot in Teams capable of helping users accomplish a specific task using natural language right in the Teams conversations, such as solving a math problem.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**
> To run the AI Assistant Bot template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - An account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com).
> 
> **Note**
>
> The `AssistantsPlanner` in `Microsoft.Teams.AI` is currently experimental.

### Create your own OpenAI Assistant

Before running or debugging your bot, please follow these steps to setup your own [OpenAI Assistant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview).

**If you haven't setup any Assistant yet**

> This app template provides script `Create-Assistant.ps1` to help create assistant. You can change the instructions and settings in the script to customize the assistant.
> 
> After creation, you can change and manage your assistants on [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/assistants).

1. Open PowerShell, change the current working directory to this project root and run command `. ./Create-Assistant.ps1 -OPENAI_API_KEY <your-openai-api-key>`
   ```
   > . ./Create-Assistant.ps1 -OPENAI_API_KEY xxxxxx
   ```
2. The above command will output the properties of the new created assistant, including the ID like "id: asst_xxx..."

### Debug bot app in Teams Web Client

1. Fill in both OpenAI API Key and the created Assistant ID into `env/.env.local.user`
   ```
   SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
   SECRET_OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=<your-openai-assistant-id>
   ```
2. In the debug dropdown menu, select Dev Tunnels > Create A Tunnel (set authentication type to Public) or select an existing public dev tunnel
3. Right-click your project and select Teams Toolkit > Prepare Teams App Dependencies
4. If prompted, sign in with a Microsoft 365 account for the Teams organization you want 
to install the app to
5. Press F5, or select the Debug > Start Debugging menu in Visual Studio
6. In the launched browser, select the Add button to load the app in Teams
7. In the chat bar, type and send anything to your bot to trigger a response

### Debug bot app in Teams App Test Tool
1. Fill in both OpenAI API Key and the created Assistant ID into `appsettings.TestTool.json`
   ```
   "OpenAI": {
      "ApiKey": "<your-openai-api-key>",
      "AssistantId": "<your-openai-assistant-id>"
   }
   ```
2. Select `Teams App Test Tool (browser)` in debug dropdown menu
3. Press F5, or select the Debug > Start Debugging menu in Visual Studio
