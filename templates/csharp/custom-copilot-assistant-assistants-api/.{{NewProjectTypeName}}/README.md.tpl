# Overview of the AI Agent template

This template showcases a bot app that responds to user questions like an AI assistant. This enables your users to talk with the AI assistant in Teams to find information.

The app template is built using the Teams AI library, which provides the capabilities to build AI-based Teams applications.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**
> To run the AI Chat Bot template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
{{#useOpenAI}}
> - an account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com).
{{/useOpenAI}}
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
> - [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) resource
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}

## Create your Assistant 
**Before running or debugging your bot, follow these steps to setup your own Assistant.**

> This app template provides script `Create-Assistant.ps1` to help create assistant. The app assistant provides capabilities such as solving a math problem, calling functions for city weather and city nickname. Get more information in `ActionHandlers.cs`. You can change the instructions and settings in the script to customize assistant.
{{#useOpenAI}}
1. Ensure your OpenAI settings filled in `appsettings.TestTool.json`.
    ```
    "OpenAI": {
      "ApiKey": "<your-openai-api-key>"
    }
    ```
{{/useOpenAI}}
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
1. Ensure your Azure OpenAI settings filled in `appsettings.TestTool.json`.
    ```
    "Azure": {
      "OpenAIApiKey": "<your-azure-openai-api-key>",
      "OpenAIEndpoint": "<your-azure-openai-endpoint>",
      "OpenAIDeploymentName": "<your-azure-openai-deployment-name>"
    }
    ```
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}
1. Open PowerShell, change the current working directory to this project root and run command `. ./Create-Assistant.ps1`.
   ```
