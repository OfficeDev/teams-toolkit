# Overview of Custom Search Results app template

## Build a message extension from a new API with Azure Functions

This app template allows Teams to interact directly with third-party data, apps, and services, enhancing its capabilities and broadening its range of capabilities. It allows Teams to:

- Retrieve real-time information, for example, latest news coverage on a product launch.
- Retrieve knowledge-based information, for example, my teamâ€™s design files in Figma.

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run this app template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts)
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli)

1. First, select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
3. Select `Debug in Teams (Edge)` or `Debug in Teams (Chrome)` from the launch configuration dropdown.
4. When Teams launches in the browser, you can navigate to a chat message and [trigger your search commands from compose message area](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions?tabs=dotnet#search-commands).

| File                 | Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `teamsapp.yml`       | This is the main Teams Toolkit project file. The project file defines two primary things: Properties and configuration Stage definitions.                                                                                                               |
| `teamsapp.local.yml` | This overrides `teamsapp.yml` with actions that enable local execution and debugging.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `aad.manifest.json`  | This file defines the configuration of Microsoft Entra app. This template will only provision [single tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/single-and-multi-tenant-apps#who-can-sign-in-to-your-app) Microsoft Entra app. |

## How Microsoft Entra works

> **Note**: The Azure Active Directory (AAD) flow is only functional in remote environments. It cannot be tested in a local environment due to the lack of authentication support in Azure Function core tools.
