# Overview of the Copilot Plugin template

## Build a Copilot Plugin from a new API with Azure Functions

With Copilot extensibility, you can augment Copilot for Microsoft 365 with custom skills and organizational knowledge specific to your enterprise and users to enable truly spectacular AI scenarios. For example:

- Retrieve knowledge-based information, for example, my teamâ€™s design files in Figma.

When you extend Copilot for Microsoft 365, you maximize the efficiency of your apps and data with AI, by:

- Enriching the data estate of your enterprise with industry-leading AI.
- Keeping your users in the flow of their work, start to finish.
- Inheriting world-class security, compliance, and privacy policies.

>
> To run this app template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts)
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit-cli)

1. First, select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
3. Select `Debug in Copilot (Edge)` or `Debug in Copilot (Chrome)` from the launch configuration dropdown.
4. When Teams launches in the browser, open the `Copilot` app.

### How to add your own API Key

1. Open terminal and run command `npm install` to install all dependency packages

   ```
   > npm install
   ```

2. After `npm install` completed, run command `npm run keygen`
   ```
   > npm run keygen
   ```
3. The above command will output something like "Generated a new API Key: xxx..."
4. Fill in API Key into `env/.env.*.user`
   ```
   SECRET_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
   ```
