# Overview of the Declarative Agent template

## Build a Declarative Agent with API Plugin from a new API with Azure Functions

With the declarative agent, you can build a custom version of copilot that can be used for specific scenarios, such as for specialized knowledge, implementing specific processes, or simply to save time by reusing a set of AI prompts. For example, a grocery shopping declarative agent can be used to create a grocery list based on a meal API that you integrate with your declarative agent.

API plugins enable declarative agents in Microsoft 365 Copilot to interact with REST APIs that have an OpenAPI description. With an API plugin, users can ask a declarative agent to not only query a REST API for information, but to create, update, and delete data and objects. Anything the REST API can do is accessible via natural language prompts.

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run this app template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18, 20
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts)
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit-cli)
> - [Microsoft 365 Copilot license](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/prerequisites#prerequisites)

1. First, select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
3. Select `Debug in Copilot (Edge)` or `Debug in Copilot (Chrome)` from the launch configuration dropdown.
4. Once the Copilot app is loaded in the browser, click on the "â€¦" menu and select "Copilot chats". You will see your declarative agent on the right rail. Clicking on it will change the experience to showcase the logo and name of your declarative agent.
5. Ask your declarative agent a question, such as "Show repair records assigned to Karin Blair". It will respond with the relevant repair records.
   > Note: Please make sure to switch to New Teams when Teams web client has launched
