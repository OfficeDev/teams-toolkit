# Overview of the AI Agent template

This app template is built on top of [Teams AI library](https://aka.ms/teams-ai-library) and [OpenAI Assistants API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview).
It showcases how to build an AI agent in Teams capable of helping users accomplish specific tasks using natural language right in the Teams conversations, such as solving a math problem, call functions to get city weather, etc.

## Get started with the AI Agent template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the AI Agent template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
{{^enableTestToolByDefault}}
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts)
{{/enableTestToolByDefault}}
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli)
> - An account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
>
> **Note**
>
> The `AssistantsPlanner` in Teams AI Library is currently in preview version.

### Create your own OpenAI Assistant

Before running or debugging your bot, please follow these steps to setup your own [OpenAI Assistant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview).

**If you haven't setup any Assistant yet**

> This app template provides script `src/creator.js` to help create assistant. You can change the instructions and settings in the script to customize the assistant.
> 
> After creation, you can change and manage your assistants on [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/assistants).

1. Open terminal and run command `npm install` to install all dependency packages
   ```
   > npm install
   ```
1. After `npm install` completed, run command `npm run assistant:create -- <your-openai-api-key>`
   ```
   > npm run assistant:create -- xxxxxx
   ```
1. The above command will output something like "*Created a new assistant with an ID of: **asst_xxx...***"
1. Fill in both OpenAI API Key and the created Assistant ID into `env/.env.*.user`
   ```
   SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
   OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=<your-openai-assistant-id>
   ```

**If you already have an Assistant created**

1. Fill in both OpenAI API Key and the created Assistant ID into `env/.env.*.user`
   ```
   SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
   OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=<your-openai-assistant-id>
   ```

### Run Teams Bot locally
