# Overview of the Chat With Your Data (Custom Data Source) template

This app template showcases how to build one of the most powerful applications enabled by LLM - sophisticated question-answering (Q&A) chat bots that can answer questions about specific source information right in the Microsoft Teams.
This app template also demonstrates usage of techniques like: 
- [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/#what-is-rag), or RAG.
- [Teams AI Library](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/teams%20conversational%20ai/teams-conversation-ai-overview)

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli)
{{#useOpenAI}}
> - An account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
{{/useOpenAI}}
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
> - Prepare your own [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) resource.
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}

> For local debugging using Teams Toolkit CLI, you need to do some extra steps described in [Set up your Teams Toolkit CLI for local debugging](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli-debugging).

1. First, select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
{{#useOpenAI}}
1. In file *env/.env.testtool.user*, fill in your OpenAI key `SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>`.
{{/useOpenAI}}
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
1. In file *env/.env.testtool.user*, fill in your Azure OpenAI key `SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>`, endpoint `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your-endpoint>` and deployment name `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<your-deployment>`.
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}
1. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Teams App Test Tool using a web browser. Select `Debug in Test Tool`.
1. You can send any message to get a response from the bot.

**Congratulations**! You are running an application that can now interact with users in Teams App Test Tool:
