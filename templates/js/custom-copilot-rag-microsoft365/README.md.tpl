# Overview of the M365 RAG Bot template

This app template is built on top of [Teams AI library](https://aka.ms/teams-ai-library).
It showcases how to build an RAG bot in Teams capable of chatting with users but with context provided by M365 content from Microsoft Graph Search API.

## Get started with the M365 RAG Bot template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the AI Search bot template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
> - A Microsoft 365 tenant in which you have permission to upload Teams apps. You can get a free Microsoft 365 developer tenant by joining the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program).
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli).
{{#useOpenAI}}
> - An account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
{{/useOpenAI}}
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
> - Prepare your own [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) resource.
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}

1. First, select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
{{#useOpenAI}}
1. In file *env/.env.local.user*, fill in your OpenAI key `SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>`.
{{/useOpenAI}}
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
1. In file *env/.env.local.user*, fill in your Azure OpenAI key `SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>`, endpoint `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your-endpoint>` and deployment name `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<your-deployment>`.
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}
1. Microsoft Graph Search API is available for searching SharePoint content, thus you just need to ensure your document in *src/data/\*.md* is uploaded to SharePoint / OneDrive, no extra data ingestion required.
1. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Teams using a web browser. Select `Debug in Teams (Edge)` or `Debug in Teams (Chrome)`.
1. When Teams launches in the browser, select the Add button in the dialog to install your app to Teams.
1. You can send any message to get a response from the bot.

**Congratulations**! You are running an application that can now interact with users in Teams App Test Tool:
