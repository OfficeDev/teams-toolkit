# Overview of the Chat With Your Data (Using Microsoft 365 Data) template

This app template showcases how to build one of the most powerful applications enabled by LLM - sophisticated question-answering (Q&A) chat bots that can answer questions about specific source information right in the Microsoft Teams.
This app template also demonstrates usage of techniques like: 
- [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/#what-is-rag), or RAG.
- [Microsoft Graph Search API](https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/search-concept-overview)
- [Teams AI Library](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/teams%20conversational%20ai/teams-conversation-ai-overview)

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
> - A Microsoft 365 tenant in which you have permission to upload Teams apps. You can get a free Microsoft 365 developer tenant by joining the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program).
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli).
{{#useOpenAI}}
> - An account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
{{/useOpenAI}}
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
> - Prepare your own [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access) resource.
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}

> [!TIP]
> You can adjust this template to use data from a Microsoft Graph connector. Follow the steps in the [CodeTour](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour) included in the project to apply the necessary changes. To use data from a Microsoft Graph connector, you need a Graph connector deployed to your tenant. For testing, we recommend using the [Ingest custom API data using TypeScript, Node.js and Teams Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://adoption.microsoft.com/sample-solution-gallery/sample/pnp-graph-connector-nodejs-typescript-food-catalog) sample.

> For local debugging using Teams Toolkit CLI, you need to do some extra steps described in [Set up your Teams Toolkit CLI for local debugging](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli-debugging).

1. First, select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
{{#useOpenAI}}
1. In file *env/.env.local.user*, fill in your OpenAI key `SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>`.
{{/useOpenAI}}
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
1. In file *env/.env.local.user*, fill in your Azure OpenAI key `SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>`, endpoint `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=<your-endpoint>` and deployment name `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<your-deployment>`.
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}
1. Microsoft Graph Search API is available for searching SharePoint content, thus you just need to ensure your document in *src/data/\*.txt* is [uploaded to SharePoint / OneDrive](https://support.microsoft.com/office/upload-files-and-folders-to-a-library-da549fb1-1fcb-4167-87d0-4693e93cb7a0), no extra data ingestion required.
1. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Teams using a web browser. Select `Debug in Teams (Edge)` or `Debug in Teams (Chrome)`.
1. When Teams launches in the browser, select the Add button in the dialog to install your app to Teams.
1. You can send any message to get a response from the bot.
