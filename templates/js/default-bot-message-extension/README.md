# How to use this Bots and Message Extensions HelloWorld app

A bot, chatbot, or conversational bot is an app that responds to simple commands sent in chat and replies in meaningful ways. Examples of bots in everyday use include: bots that notify about build failures, bots that provide information about the weather or bus schedules, or provide travel information. A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a complex conversation. Being a cloud application, a bot can provide valuable and secure access to cloud services and corporate resources.

A Message Extension allows users to interact with your web service while composing messages in the Microsoft Teams client. Users can invoke your web service to assist message composition, from the message compose box, or from the search bar.

Message Extensions are implemented on top of the Bot support architecture within Teams.

This is a simple hello world application with both Bot and Message extension capabilities.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
- An M365 account. If you do not have M365 account, apply one from [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli)

## Debug

- From Visual Studio Code: Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code.
- Alternatively use the `Run and Debug Activity Panel` in Visual Studio Code and click the `Run and Debug` green arrow button.
- From TeamsFx CLI:
  - Install [dev tunnel cli](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-install-dev-tunnel).
  - Login with your M365 Account using the command `devtunnel user login`.
  - Start your local tunnel service by running the command `devtunnel host -p 3978 --protocol http --allow-anonymous`.
  - In the `env/.env.local` file, fill in the values for `BOT_DOMAIN` and `BOT_ENDPOINT` with your dev tunnel URL.
    ```
    BOT_DOMAIN=sample-id-3978.devtunnels.ms
    BOT_ENDPOINT=https://sample-id-3978.devtunnels.ms
    ```
  - Executing the command `teamsapp provision --env local` in your project directory.
  - Executing the command `teamsapp deploy --env local` in your project directory.
  - Executing the command `teamsapp preview --env local` in your project directory.

## Edit the manifest

You can find the Teams app manifest in `./appPackage` folder. The folder contains one manifest file:

- `manifest.json`: Manifest file for Teams app running locally or running remotely (After deployed to Azure).

This file contains template arguments with `${{...}}` statements which will be replaced at build time. You may add any extra properties or permissions you require to this file. See the [schema reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) for more information.

## Deploy to Azure

Deploy your project to Azure by following these steps:
