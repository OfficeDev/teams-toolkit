# Overview of Collect Form Input and Process Data template

A Message Extension allows users to interact with your web service while composing messages in the Microsoft Teams client. Users can search or initiate actions in an external system from compose message area, the command box, or directly from a message.

This app template implements action command that allows you to present your users with a modal pop-up called a task module in Teams. The task module collects or displays information, processes the interaction, and sends the information back to Teams.

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts)
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli)

1. First, select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
3. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Teams using a web browser. Select `Debug in Teams (Edge)` or `Debug in Teams (Chrome)`.
4. When Teams launches in the browser, select the Add button in the dialog to install your app to Teams.
5. To trigger the action command, you can click the `...` under compose message area to find your message extension.

**Congratulations**! You are running an application that can share information in rich format by creating an Adaptive Card in Teams.
