# Overview of Custom Search Results template

This app template is a search-based [message extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions?tabs=nodejs) that allows users to search an external system and share results through the compose message area of the Microsoft Teams client. You can now build and run your search-based message extensions in Teams, Copilot for Windows desktop and web experiences.

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts)
> - [Set up your dev environment for extending Teams apps across Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-m365-apps-prerequisites)
>   Please note that after you enrolled your developer tenant in Office 365 Target Release, it may take couple days for the enrollment to take effect.
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli)
> - Join Microsoft 365 Copilot Plugin development [early access program](https://aka.ms/plugins-dev-waitlist).

> For local debugging using Teams Toolkit CLI, you need to do some extra steps described in [Set up your Teams Toolkit CLI for local debugging](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli-debugging).

1. First, select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
{{^enableMETestToolByDefault}}
2. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
{{/enableMETestToolByDefault}}
{{#enableMETestToolByDefault}}
3. To directly trigger the Message Extension in Teams App Test Tool, you can:
   1. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Teams App Test Tool using a web browser. Select `Debug in Test Tool`.
   2. When Test Tool launches in the browser, click the `+` in compose message area and select `Search command` to trigger the search commands.
{{/enableMETestToolByDefault}}
3. To directly trigger the Message Extension in Teams, you can:
   1. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Teams using a web browser. Select `Debug in Teams (Edge)` or `Debug in Teams (Chrome)`.
   2. When Teams launches in the browser, select the Add button in the dialog to install your app to Teams.
   3. `@mention` Your message extension from the `search box area`, `@mention` your message extension from the `compose message area` or click the `...` under compose message area to find your message extension.
4. To trigger the Message Extension through Copilot, you can:
   1. Select `Debug in Copilot (Edge)` or `Debug in Copilot (Chrome)` from the launch configuration dropdown.
   2. When Teams launches in the browser, click the `Apps` icon from Teams client left rail to open Teams app store and search for `Copilot`.
   3. Open the `Copilot` app, select `Plugins`, and from the list of plugins, turn on the toggle for your message extension. Now, you can send a prompt to trigger your plugin.
   4. Send a message to Copilot to find an NPM package information. For example: `Find the npm package info on teamsfx-react`.
      > Note: This prompt may not always make Copilot include a response from your message extension. If it happens, try some other prompts or leave a feedback to us by thumbing down the Copilot response and leave a message tagged with [MessageExtension].

**Congratulations**! You are running an application that can now search npm registries in Teams and Copilot.

## What's included in the template

| Folder        | Contents                                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `.vscode/`    | VSCode files for debugging                   |
| `appPackage/` | Templates for the Teams application manifest |
| `env/`        | Environment files                            |
| `infra/`      | Templates for provisioning Azure resources   |
| `src/`        | The source code for the search application   |

The following files can be customized and demonstrate an example implementation to get you started.

| File               | Contents                                                                                       |

| `src/searchApp.js` | Handles the business logic for this app template to query npm registry and return result list. |
| `src/index.js`     | `index.js` is used to setup and configure the Message Extension.                               |

The following are Teams Toolkit specific project files. You can [visit a complete guide on Github](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/Teams-Toolkit-Visual-Studio-Code-v5-Guide#overview) to understand how Teams Toolkit works.

| File                 | Contents                                                                                                                                  |

| `teamsapp.yml`       | This is the main Teams Toolkit project file. The project file defines two primary things: Properties and configuration Stage definitions. |
| `teamsapp.local.yml` | This overrides `teamsapp.yml` with actions that enable local execution and debugging.                                                     |
| `teamsapp.testtool.yml`| This overrides `teamsapp.yml` with actions that enable local execution and debugging in Teams App Test Tool.                            |
