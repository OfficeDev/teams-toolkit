# Overview of the Chat With Your Data (Using Azure AI Search) template

This app template showcases how to build one of the most powerful applications enabled by LLM - sophisticated question-answering (Q&A) chat bots that can answer questions about specific source information right in the Microsoft Teams.
This app template also demonstrates usage of techniques like: 
- [Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/question_answering/#what-is-rag), or RAG.
- [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search)
- [Teams AI Library](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/teams%20conversational%20ai/teams-conversation-ai-overview)

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Python](https://www.python.org/), version 3.8 to 3.11.
> - [Python extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python), version v2024.0.1 or higher.
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) latest version or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit-cli).
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
> - An account with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access).
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}
{{#useOpenAI}}
> - An account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
{{/useOpenAI}}
> - An [Azure Search service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search).
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts).

### Configurations
1. Open the command box and enter `Python: Create Environment` to create and activate your desired virtual environment. Remember to select `src/requirements.txt` as dependencies to install when creating the virtual environment.
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
1. In file *env/.env.local.user*, fill in your Azure OpenAI key `SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, deployment name `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`, endpoint `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` and embedding deployment name `AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT`.
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}
{{#useOpenAI}}
1. In file *env/.env.local.user*, fill in your OpenAI key `SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY`. 
1. In this template, default model name is `gpt-3.5-turbo` and default embedding model name is `text-embedding-ada-002`. If you want to use different models from OpenAI, fill in your model names in [src/config.py](./src/config.py).
{{/useOpenAI}}
1. In file *env/.env.local.user*, fill in your Azure Search key `SECRET_AZURE_SEARCH_KEY` and endpoint `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT`.

### Setting up index and documents
1. Azure Search endpoint `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT` is loaded from *env/.env.local.user*. Please make sure you have already configured it.
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
1. Use the following command with your api key to create index and upload documents in `src/indexers/data`.
    ```
    python src/indexers/setup.py --api-key <your-azure-openai-api-key> --ai-search-key <your-azure-ai-search-key>
    ```
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}
{{#useOpenAI}}
1. Use the following command with your api key to create index and upload documents in `src/indexers/data`.
    ```
    python src/indexers/setup.py --api-key <your-openai-api-key> --ai-search-key <your-azure-ai-search-key>
    ```
{{/useOpenAI}}
1. You will see the following information indicated the success of setup:
    ```
    Create index succeeded. If it does not exist, wait for 5 seconds...
    Upload new documents succeeded. If they do not exist, wait for several seconds...
    setup finished
    ```
1. Once you're done using the sample it's good practice to delete the index. You can do so with the command `python src/indexers/delete.py --ai-search-key <your-azure-ai-search-key>`.

### Conversation with bot
1. Select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
1. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
1. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Teams using a web browser. Select `Debug in Teams (Edge)` or `Debug in Teams (Chrome)`.
1. When Teams launches in the browser, select the Add button in the dialog to install your app to Teams.
1. You will receive a welcome message from the bot, or send any message to get a response.

**Congratulations**! You are running an application that can now interact with users in Teams:

> For local debugging using Teams Toolkit CLI, you need to do some extra steps described in [Set up your Teams Toolkit CLI for local debugging](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli-debugging).

## Extend the template

- Follow [Build a Basic AI Chatbot in Teams](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-basic-ai-chatbot) to extend the template with more AI capabilities.
- Follow [Build a RAG Bot in Teams](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-rag-bot) to extend the template with more RAG capabilities. In this template, we upload raw text data to Azure AI Search. Azure AI Search also allows you to create vectorized data and do vector similarity search. 
You can refer to the section [integrate-vectorization](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/Build-a-RAG-Bot-in-Teams#integrate-vectorization) or the demo [integrated-vectorization](https://github.com/Azure/azure-search-vector-samples/tree/main/demo-python/code/integrated-vectorization) for more details.
- Understand more about [Azure AI Search as data source](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-rag-bot#azure-ai-search-as-data-source).

## Known issue
- If you use `Debug in Test Tool` to local debug, you might get an error `InternalServiceError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:3978` in Test Tool console log or error message `Error: Cannot connect to your app,
please make sure your app is running or restart your app` in log panel of Test Tool web page. You can wait for Python launch console ready and then refresh the front end web page.
- When you use `Launch Remote in Teams` to remote debug after deployment, you might loose interaction with your bot. This is because the remote service needs to restart. Please wait for several minutes to retry it.
