# Overview of the AI Search Bot template

This template showcases a bot app that responds to user questions like an AI assistant according to data from Azure Search. This enables your users to talk with the AI assistant in Teams to find information.

The app template is built using the Teams AI library, which provides the capabilities to build AI-based Teams applications.

## Get started with the AI Search Bot template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the AI Search Bot template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Python](https://www.python.org/), version 3.8 to 3.11.
> - [Python extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python), version v2024.0.1 or higher.
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) latest version or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli).
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
> - An account with [Azure OpenAI](https://aka.ms/oai/access).
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}
{{#useOpenAI}}
> - An account with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).
{{/useOpenAI}}
> - An [Azure Search service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search).
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (supported versions: 16, 18) for local debug in Test Tool.

### Configurations
1. Open the command box and enter `Python: Create Environment` to create and activate your desired virtual environment. Remember to select `src/requirements.txt` as dependencies to install when creating the virtual environment.
{{#useAzureOpenAI}}
1. In file *env/.env.testtool.user*, fill in your Azure OpenAI key `SECRET_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, deployment name `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`, endpoint `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` and embedding deployment name `AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT`.
{{/useAzureOpenAI}}
{{#useOpenAI}}
1. In file *env/.env.testtool.user*, fill in your OpenAI key `SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY`. 
1. In this template, default model name is `gpt-3.5-turbo` and default embedding model name is `text-embedding-ada-002`. If you want to use different models from OpenAI, fill in your model names in [src/config.py](./src/config.py).
{{/useOpenAI}}
1. In file *env/.env.local.user*, fill in your Azure Search key `SECRET_AZURE_SEARCH_KEY` and endpoint `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT`.

### Setting up index and documents
1. Azure Search key `SECRET_AZURE_SEARCH_KEY` and endpoint `AZURE_SEARCH_ENDPOINT` are loaded from *env/.env.testtool.user*. Please make sure you have already configured them.
1. Use command `python src/indexers/setup.py` to create index and upload documents in `src/indexers/data`.
1. You will see the following information indicated the success of setup:
    ```
    Create index succeeded. If it does not exist, wait for 5 seconds...
    Upload new documents succeeded. If they do not exist, wait for several seconds...
    setup finished
    ```
1. Once you're done using the sample it's good practice to delete the index. You can do so with the command `python src/indexers/delete.py`.

### Conversation with bot
1. Select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
1. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Teams App Test Tool using a web browser. Select `Debug in Test Tool (Preview)`.
1. When Teams launches in the browser, select the Add button in the dialog to install your app to Teams.
1. You will receive a welcome message from the bot, or send any message to get a response.

**Congratulations**! You are running an application that can now interact with users in Teams:
