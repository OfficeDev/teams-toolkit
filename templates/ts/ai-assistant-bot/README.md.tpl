### Create your own OpenAI Assistant

Before running or debugging your bot, please follow these steps to setup your own [OpenAI Assistant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview).

**If you haven't setup any Assistant yet**

> This app template provides script `src/creator.ts` to help create assistant. You can change the instructions and settings in the script to customize the assistant.
> 
> After creation, you can change and manage your assistants on [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/assistants).

1. Open terminal and run command `npm install` to install all dependency packages

   ```
   > npm install
   ```
1. After `npm install` completed, run command `npm run assistant:create -- <your-openai-api-key>`
   ```
   > npm run assistant:create -- xxxxxx
   ```
1. The above command will output something like "*Created a new assistant with an ID of: **asst_xxx...***"
1. Fill in both OpenAI API Key and the created Assistant ID into `env/.env.*.user`
   ```
   SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
   SECRET_OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=<your-openai-assistant-id>
   ```

**If you already have an Assistant created**

1. Fill in both OpenAI API Key and the created Assistant ID into `env/.env.*.user`
   ```
   SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
   SECRET_OPENAI_ASSISTANT_ID=<your-openai-assistant-id>
   ```
