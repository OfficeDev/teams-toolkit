## Build an API Plugin from a new API with Azure Functions

With Copilot extensibility, you can augment Copilot for Microsoft 365 with custom skills and organizational knowledge specific to your enterprise and users to enable truly spectacular AI scenarios. For example:

- Retrieve real-time information, for example, latest news coverage on a product launch.
- Retrieve knowledge-based information, for example, my teamâ€™s design files in Figma.

When you extend Copilot for Microsoft 365, you maximize the efficiency of your apps and data with AI, by:

- Enriching the data estate of your enterprise with industry-leading AI.
- Keeping your users in the flow of their work, start to finish.
- Inheriting world-class security, compliance, and privacy policies.

# Overview of the declarative Copilot with API plugin template

## Build a declarative Copilot with an API Plugin from a new API with Azure Functions

With the declarative copilot, you can build a custom version of Copilot that can be used for specific scenarios, such as for specialized knowledge, implementing specific processes, or simply to save time by reusing a set of AI prompts. For example, a grocery shopping Copilot declarative copilot can be used to create a grocery list based on a meal plan that you send to Copilot.

You can extend declarative copilots using plugins to retrieve data and execute tasks on external systems. A declarative copilot can utilize multiple plugins at the same time.

## Get started with the template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run this app template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 18
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts)
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit-cli)
> - [Copilot for Microsoft 365 license](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/prerequisites#prerequisites)

1. First, select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
3. Select `Debug in Copilot (Edge)` or `Debug in Copilot (Chrome)` from the launch configuration dropdown.

4. When Teams launches in the browser, open the `Copilot` app.
5. Select `Plugins`, and from the list of plugins, turn on the toggle for your plugin. Now, you can send a prompt to trigger your plugin.
   > Note: Please make sure to switch to New Teams when Teams web client has launched

{{#DeclarativeCopilot}}
4. Select your declarative Copilot from the `Copilot` app.
5. Send a message to Copilot to find a repair record.

### How to add your own API Key

1. Open terminal and run command `npm install` to install all dependency packages

   ```
   > npm install
   ```

2. After `npm install` completed, run command `npm run keygen`
   ```
   > npm run keygen
   ```
3. The above command will output something like "Generated a new API Key: xxx..."
4. Fill in API Key into `env/.env.*.user`
   ```
   SECRET_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
   ```
