# Overview of the API Plugin template

## Build an API Plugin from a new API with Azure Functions

With Copilot extensibility, you can augment Microsoft 365 Copilot with custom skills and organizational knowledge specific to your enterprise and users to enable truly spectacular AI scenarios. For example:

- Retrieve real-time information, for example, latest news coverage on a product launch.
- Retrieve knowledge-based information, for example, my team’s design files in Figma.

When you extend Microsoft 365 Copilot, you maximize the efficiency of your apps and data with AI, by:

- Enriching the data estate of your enterprise with industry-leading AI.
- Keeping your users in the flow of their work, start to finish.
- Inheriting world-class security, compliance, and privacy policies.

# Overview of the declarative agent with API plugin template

## Build a declarative agent with an API Plugin from a new API with Azure Functions

With the declarative agent, you can build a custom version of Copilot that can be used for specific scenarios, such as for specialized knowledge, implementing specific processes, or simply to save time by reusing a set of AI prompts. For example, a grocery shopping Copilot declarative agent can be used to create a grocery list based on a meal plan that you send to Copilot.

You can extend declarative agents using plugins to retrieve data and execute tasks on external systems. A declarative agent can utilize multiple plugins at the same time.
