- Retrieve real-time information, for example, latest news coverage on a product launch.
- Retrieve knowledge-based information, for example, my teamâ€™s design files in Figma.

When you extend Microsoft 365 Copilot, you maximize the efficiency of your apps and data with AI, by:

- Enriching the data estate of your enterprise with industry-leading AI.
- Keeping your users in the flow of their work, start to finish.
- Inheriting world-class security, compliance, and privacy policies.

# Overview of the declarative agent with API plugin template

## Build a declarative agent with an API Plugin from a new API with Azure Functions

With the declarative agent, you can build a custom version of Copilot that can be used for specific scenarios, such as for specialized knowledge, implementing specific processes, or simply to save time by reusing a set of AI prompts. For example, a grocery shopping Copilot declarative agent can be used to create a grocery list based on a meal plan that you send to Copilot.

You can extend declarative agents using plugins to retrieve data and execute tasks on external systems. A declarative agent can utilize multiple plugins at the same time.
