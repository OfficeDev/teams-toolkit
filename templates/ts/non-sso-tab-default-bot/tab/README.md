# How to use this Teams Tab app HelloWorld app

Microsoft Teams supports the ability to run web-based UI inside "custom tabs" that users can install either for just themselves (personal tabs) or within a team or group chat context.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
- An M365 account. If you do not have M365 account, apply one from [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli)

## Debug

- From Visual Studio Code: Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code.
- Alternatively use the `Run and Debug Activity Panel` in Visual Studio Code and click the `Run and Debug` green arrow button.
- From Teams Toolkit CLI:
  - Executing the command `teamsapp provision --env local` in your project directory.
  - Executing the command `teamsapp deploy --env local` in your project directory.
  - Executing the command `teamsapp preview --env local` in your project directory.

## Edit the manifest

You can find the Teams app manifest in `../appPackage` folder. The folder contains one manifest file:

- `manifest.json`: Manifest file for Teams app running locally or running remotely (After deployed to Azure).

This file contains template arguments with `${{...}}` statements which will be replaced at build time. You may add any extra properties or permissions you require to this file. See the [schema reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) for more information.

## Deploy to Azure

Deploy your project to Azure by following these steps:

| From Visual Studio Code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | From Teams Toolkit CLI                                                                                                                                                     |

## Preview

Once the provisioning and deployment steps are finished, you can preview your app:

- From Visual Studio Code

  1. Open the `Run and Debug Activity Panel`.
  1. Select `Launch Remote (Edge)` or `Launch Remote (Chrome)` from the launch configuration drop-down.
  1. Press the Play (green arrow) button to launch your app - now running remotely from Azure.

- From Teams Toolkit CLI: execute `teamsapp preview --remote` in your project directory to launch your application.

## Validate manifest file

To check that your manifest file is valid:

- From Visual Studio Code: open the command palette and select: `Teams: Validate Application`.
- From Teams Toolkit CLI: run command `teamsapp validate` in your project directory.

## Package

- From Visual Studio Code: open the Teams Toolkit and click `Zip Teams App Package` or open the command palette and select `Teams: Zip Teams App Package`.
- Alternatively, from the command line run `teamsapp package` in the project directory.

## Publish to Teams

Once deployed, you may want to distribute your application to your organization's internal app store in Teams. Your app will be submitted for admin approval.

- From Visual Studio Code: open the Teams Toolkit and click `Publish` or open the command palette and select: `Teams: Publish`.
- From Teams Toolkit CLI: run command `teamsapp publish` in your project directory.

## Add Single Sign On feature

Microsoft Teams provides a mechanism by which an application can obtain the signed-in Teams user token to access Microsoft Graph (and other APIs). Teams Toolkit facilitates this interaction by abstracting some of the Microsoft Entra flows and integrations behind some simple, high-level APIs. This enables you to add single sign-on (SSO) features easily to your Teams application.

Please follow this [document](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-add-sso-new) to add single sign on for your project.
