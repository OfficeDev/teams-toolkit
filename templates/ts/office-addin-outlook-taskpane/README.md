# Build Outlook add-ins using Teams Toolkit
Outlook add-ins are integrations built by third parties into Outlook by using our web-based platform.
Now you have the ability to create a single unit of distribution for all your Microsoft 365 extensions by using the same manifest format and schema, based on the current JSON-formatted Teams manifest.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/): version 18 or 20
- Outlook for Windows: Beta Channel, Build 16320 or higher. Follow [this link](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/How-to-switch-Outlook-client-update-channel-and-verify-Outlook-client-build-version) for switching update channels and check your Outlook client build version.
- Edge installed for debugging Outlook add-in.
- An M365 account. If you do not have M365 account, apply one from [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher.

## Debug Outlook add-in
- Please note that the same M365 account should be used both in Teams Toolkit and Outlook.
- From Visual Studio Code: Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code. Please run VSCode as administrator if localhost loopback for Microsoft Edge Webview hasn't been enabled. Once enbaled, administrator priviledge is no longer required.

## Edit the manifest

You can find the app manifest in `./appPackage` folder. The folder contains one manifest file:
* `manifest.json`: Manifest file for Outlook add-in running locally or running remotely (After deployed to Azure).
You may add any extra properties or permissions you require to this file. See the [schema reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-app-schema/preview/op/extensions/MicrosoftTeams.schema.json) for more information.

## Deploy to Azure

Deploy your project to Azure by following these steps:

| From Visual Studio Code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | From Teams Toolkit CLI                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

> Note: Provisioning and deployment may incur charges to your Azure Subscription.

To sideload the deployed add-in:

- Copy the production URL from the `ADDIN_ENDPOINT` in env/.env.dev file.
- Edit webpack.config.js file and change `urlProd` to the value you just copied. Please note to add a '/' at the end of the URL.
- Run `npm run build`.
- Run `npx office-addin-dev-settings sideload ./dist/manifest.json`.

## Validate manifest file

To check that your manifest file is valid:

- From Visual Studio Code: open the command palette and select: `Teams: Validate Application` and select `Validate using manifest schema`.
- From Teams Toolkit CLI: run command `teamsapp validate` in your project directory.

## Known Issues
- Publish is not supported for an Outlook add-in project now.
