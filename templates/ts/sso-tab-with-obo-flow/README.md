# Overview of the React with Fluent UI template

This app showcases how to craft a visually appealing web page that can be embedded in Microsoft Teams, Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app with React and Fluent UI. The app also enhances the end-user experiences with built-in single sign-on and data from Microsoft Graph.

This app has adopted [On-Behalf-Of flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow) to implement SSO, and uses Azure Functions as middle-tier service, and make authenticated requests to call Graph from Azure Functions.

## Get started with the React with Fluent UI template

> **Prerequisites**
>
> To run the command bot template in your local dev machine, you will need:
>
> - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), supported versions: 16, 18
> - A [Microsoft 365 account for development](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts)
> - [Set up your dev environment for extending Teams apps across Microsoft 365](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-m365-apps-prerequisites)
>   Please note that after you enrolled your developer tenant in Office 365 Target Release, it may take couple days for the enrollment to take effect.
> - [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version 5.0.0 and higher or [Teams Toolkit CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-toolkit-cli)

1. First, select the Teams Toolkit icon on the left in the VS Code toolbar.
2. In the Account section, sign in with your [Microsoft 365 account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/toolkit/accounts) if you haven't already.
3. Press F5 to start debugging which launches your app in Teams using a web browser. Select `Debug in Teams (Edge)` or `Debug in Teams (Chrome)`.
4. When Teams launches in the browser, select the Add button in the dialog to install your app to Teams.

**Congratulations**! You are running an application that can now show a beautiful web page in Teams, Outlook and the Microsoft 365 app.

The following are Teams Toolkit specific project files. You can [visit a complete guide on Github](https://github.com/OfficeDev/TeamsFx/wiki/Teams-Toolkit-Visual-Studio-Code-v5-Guide#overview) to understand how Teams Toolkit works.

| File                 | Contents                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `teamsapp.yml`       | This is the main Teams Toolkit project file. The project file defines two primary things: Properties and configuration Stage definitions.                                                                                                               |
| `teamsapp.local.yml` | This overrides `teamsapp.yml` with actions that enable local execution and debugging.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `aad.manifest.json`  | This file defines the configuration of Microsoft Entra app. This template will only provision [single tenant](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/single-and-multi-tenant-apps#who-can-sign-in-to-your-app) Microsoft Entra app. |
